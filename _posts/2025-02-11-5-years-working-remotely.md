# Introduction

These days I'm celebrating several anniversaries, which has inspired me to write a series of posts to commemorate these milestones and share my experiences. This particular post is dedicated to my fifth anniversary as a remote worker. It's hard to believe it's been five years since I took the plunge and embraced working from home full-time. Before that, I only worked remotely occasionally in my previous jobs, never more than a few days a month. So, I thought I'd share my journey and offer some insights that might be helpful to others.

## Disclaimer: It's Not for Everyone

Let's be real, working from home isn't for everyone. There are various reasons why it might not be a good fit: you may do better in a more structured environment, perhaps your home isn't suited to focused work (noisy kids, anyone?), or maybe you simply lack a dedicated workspace. What follows is a non-exhaustive list of things that have helped me successfully navigate the world of remote work.

# Routine

First and foremost, establish a routine that helps you mentally transition into work mode. For those accustomed to office life, this often includes a commute. While it may seem trivial, that commute plays a crucial role in shifting our mindset from home/leisure to work. As remote workers, we do not have this transition, so it's vital to create a routine that serves the same purpose.

My personal routine involves waking up, having breakfast, doing some light stretching to shake off the morning stiffness, brushing my teeth, and getting dressed. Yes, I know, working in pajamas or your underwear sounds incredibly tempting, but I've found that getting dressed helps me feel more professional and productive. If you're unsure whether this applies to you, I encourage you to experiment. Try working in your pajamas one day and getting dressed the next. See if it makes a difference in your focus and motivation. There's no one-size-fits-all solution, so find what works best for you. It took me some time to establish my ideal routine.

Just as we have a routine to start the day, we should also have one to end it. It's crucial to strike a balance between our professional responsibilities and the activities that bring us joy and enrich our lives. I'd say the most important aspect of this is setting a clear end time for your workday. After that time, work is off-limits. Communicate this boundary to your colleagues, bosses, clients, etc. It may seem challenging at first, but once you establish this habit and train others to respect it, disconnecting becomes much easier.

# Environment

This can be a tricky one, as it's often difficult, if not impossible, to control external factors. Kids will be kids, the neighbor's construction crew needs to use power tools, and life happens. My best advice here is to find the quietest corner of your home. If that proves insufficient, consider a coworking space.

# Conclusion

If, after giving it a fair shot, you find that working from home isn't for you, don't force it. There's no shame in returning to the office with its familiar routines and social interactions. We are social creatures, and fulfilling those needs is more important than proving we can work from home. One last thing â€“ stay tuned for my next post, where I'll give you a tour of my workspace!
