# Introduction

Spring is a time for renewal, and also for cleaning. So I decided to do a bit of [spring cleaning](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/pull/804) on a project I'm working on, even though it was autumn. During the lifetime of the project, some files were created that made sense at the time, but nowadays they were just cluttering up the project. That's why, with great regret, I had to delete them.

# The files I deleted

* [WISHLIST](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/blob/48aa12af31c0b72872b411857d03a518a4200a3d/doc/WISHLIST): This was a text file where the ideas and improvements for the project were written. It was a good way to keep track of them. I realized most of the items on the list were unrealistic, outdated, or irrelevant. So I decided to let it go and focus on the present and the future of the project.

* [README.platforms](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/blob/48aa12af31c0b72872b411857d03a518a4200a3d/doc/README.platforms): This was a document listing all the platforms on which the project was supposed to operate. Probably tt was a useful reference at the time, but it also became a burden.

* [shadow.spec.in](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/blob/48aa12af31c0b72872b411857d03a518a4200a3d/shadow.spec.in): RPM spec file. Probably it hadn't been updated since 1997. Thus, it didn't make any sense to have it there.

* [TODO](https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/blob/48aa12af31c0b72872b411857d03a518a4200a3d/TODO): Yet another wish list. Probably there were two files because they separated the short-term and long-term goals of the project. But who knows.

# The benefits

Deleting these files was not easy, but it was worth it. I also noticed some benefits for the project, such as:

* More clarity: Deleting these files cleared up some clutter and noise from the project. This made the project simpler and cleaner, and also improved the vision and direction for the project.

* More flexibility: Deleting these files loosened up some constraints and expectations from the project.

* More satisfaction: This made the project more enjoyable and rewarding.

# The lessons I learned

Deleting these files was a valuable learning experience for me. I learned some lessons that I can apply to future projects, such as:

* Don't be afraid to delete files that are no longer needed. They may have served a purpose in the past, but they may not be relevant or helpful in the present or the future.

* Don't be attached to files that are no longer useful. They may have been important or meaningful at some point, but they may not be worth keeping or maintaining anymore as they may not be adding or contributing anything to the project anymore.

# Conclusion

Spring cleaning is not only for your home, but also for your projects. Sometimes, you need to delete some files that are no longer needed, useful, or beneficial. This can help you save space, gain clarity, increase flexibility, and achieve satisfaction. It can also help you improve the quality and performance of your project, and make it more successful and enjoyable.

Happy spring cleaning!
