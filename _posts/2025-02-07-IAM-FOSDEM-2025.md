I attended the [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) conference in Brussels from February 1st to 2nd. As one of the world's largest open source conferences, with over 8,000 attendees and 70 devrooms, FOSDEM provided an invaluable opportunity to connect with communities and organizations using our software. These in-person interactions are particularly important as they often represent one of our only chances to engage with these groups throughout the year.

This year it was the 25th anniversary of the event, and as such there were special celebrations. The opening talk happens at Janson auditorium, with a capacity of 1500 seats and packed to the rafters, including lots of people standing in the sides and the back. This year there were more than 1000 talks, and almost as many speakers (900+), thus making it a great place to reach a very wide audience.

# Identity and Access Management devroom

[Alexander Bokovoy](https://github.com/abbra) and I managed the [Identity and Access Management devroom](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/iam/) for another year, and the interest was overwhelming. We received over 30 talk proposals, showcasing the diverse landscape of IAM. The 16 talks we selected spanned the field, from practical deployment challenges and complex infrastructure integrations (including AI/HPC) to emerging areas like federated identities, passwordless authentication, and digital certificate lifecycle management. The larger devroom (increased from 80 to ~250 seats) was a welcome change, comfortably accommodating the consistently high attendance.

Without further ado, let's jump into the topics presented by Red Hatters.

[Welcome to the Identity and Access Management devroom!](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4065-welcome-to-identity-and-access-management-devroom-/) by Alexander Bokovoy and Iker Pedrosa: Short self-introduction of the main devroom leaders, where we explained what the devroom would consist of and give some tips on how to proceed to the speakers and the audience.

[Heimdall: An Identity-Aware Proxy for Secure Access Control](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4883-heimdall-an-identity-aware-proxy-for-secure-access-control/) by Dimitrij Drus: this presentation explored the components of a decentralized access control system and the integration challenges posed by diverse protocols and services. The speaker introduced Heimdall as a solution designed to abstract these complexities and simplify the definition of business logic. A demonstration illustrated Heimdall's capabilities.

[Partly Cloudy IPA - joining cloud VMs to FreeIPA](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5054-partly-cloudy-ipa-joining-cloud-vms-to-freeipa/) by André Boscatto: the speaker did a fantastic job explaining the authentication and authorization challenges of connecting cloud VMs to FreeIPA. They made the benefits of the [Podengo project](https://github.com/podengo-project) crystal clear, and the diagram and demo of the launch and connect phases were super helpful. It was great that he also pointed out other related talks in the same devroom.

[Deep Dive into OIDC flows](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5209-deep-dive-into-oidc-flows/) by Milan Jakobi: this presentation offered a practical overview of OAuth, explaining how short-lived tokens are used for resource access in servers.  The speaker used clear diagrams to illustrate the workflow, presented a relevant real-world use case, and shared valuable insights from their own experiences, including lessons learned from past mistakes. The room was nearly full for this informative session.

[Nubus: An Enterprise Open Source IAM Stack in Kubernetes](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5510-nubus-an-enterprise-open-source-iam-stack-in-kubernetes/) by Daniel Tröder: this talk about digital sovereignty and Nubus was great! The speaker did a fantastic job explaining what Nubus is and how it works.  And the diagrams were excellent (I love a good diagram!).  It was helpful to see how standardization of interfaces and data plays a key role.  The demo brought everything together nicely.

[ACME Certificates with FreeIPA: Simplify SSL/TLS Management](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5667-acme-certificates-with-freeipa-simplify-ssl-tls-management/) by José Ángel de Bustos Pérez and Josep Andreu Font: the talk covered a wide range of topics related to SSL/TLS certificate management, from explaining the ACME protocol and certificate lifecycle to addressing limitations in FreeIPA/Dog Tag and showcasing real-world use cases. The numerous demos were incredibly helpful, walking the audience through every step of certificate issuance, re-issuance, and revocation.

[systemd's User Database API](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5071-systemd-s-user-database-api/) by  	Lennart Poettering: this talk was a really insightful look at a new API for providing user records. The speaker did a great job explaining Varlink and how the user database works. It was a super interactive session, which made it even more engaging. I loved how he showed how easy it is to extend the JSON-based user records and how they're making sure sensitive fields are kept privileged and secure. Plus, it sounds like it integrates really well with existing environments, which is a huge step forward.

[Federated Identities Anyone? We've got lots of them...](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6019-federated-identities-anyone-we-ve-got-lots-of-them-/) by Stephan Schwichtenberg: this talk offered a really valuable perspective on the challenges and solutions surrounding digital identity exchange. The speaker highlighted the prevalence of digital identities and the necessity for secure exchange methods. He provided a clear explanation of how techniques like additional random identities and intent tokens can address privacy concerns. The presentation also included a crucial discussion of potential security risks, such as malware and DoS attacks.

[SSSD and IdPs](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4756-sssd-and-idps/) by Sumit Bose: this talk was a fantastic introduction to SSSD! The speaker did a great job explaining what SSSD is, where it came from, and why it's so useful. The presentation covered how to integrate OIDC/OAuth 2.0 based IdPs with Linux/POSIX systems, which is incredibly relevant in today's IT landscape. The demo was super helpful, and I think it really helped those in the audience who hadn't heard of SSSD before understand its value.

# Conclusion

Organizing the IAM devroom at FOSDEM this year was a truly special experience, one that I personally found incredibly rewarding. From the initial planning stages to the final wrap-up, the energy and enthusiasm surrounding the event were palpable. The community that came together, both speakers and attendees, was absolutely fantastic. The conversations sparked were insightful, thought-provoking and genuinely inspiring. It was a privilege to witness such a vibrant exchange of ideas and passion. And, to top it all off, being back on stage to give a talk myself was just incredible! I can't express how much I enjoyed being a part of this year's FOSDEM and the IAM devroom.
