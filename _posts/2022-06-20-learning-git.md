# Introduction

Today I'd like to present you the best way of learning the basics of Git, a web page called [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).

Why do I say that? Because this website not only teaches you the theory, but also provides a playground to perform the exercises. As if that were not enough, it also has step-by-step visual demonstrations of the core functionalities and it challenges you to optimize the steps used to solve the exercises.

# Theory

For every level there's a series of dialogs that explain the commands that you will learn in them.

Usually these dialogs also contain some kind of demo that visually shows what the command does.

# Exercise

The final step of each level is an exercise where we should demonstrate that we have gained the knowledge.

These exercises contain a box with the command line, its current status and the objective of the scenario.

# Conclusion

No matter if you are a beginner or you already have some knowledge of Git, you will surely find something to learn on this website. If this post hasn't convinced you, I recommend you to try it, you won't be disappointed.
